## Overview

This is a real-time notification system built with Socket.io, Node.js, and React. It allows users to receive instant notifications for various events, such as likes, comments, and shares, in a React-based web application. The server-side is implemented in Node.js using the Socket.io library for WebSocket communication.

## Features

- Real-time notifications: Users receive notifications instantly as events occur.
- Multiple event types: Notifications can be triggered for various event types, such as likes, comments, and shares.
- Customizable: The notification system is easily customizable and can be integrated into existing React applications.
- Scalable: The Node.js server using Socket.io is designed for scalability and high performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- A basic understanding of React, Node.js, and Socket.io.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the notification system:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/notification-system.git
   cd notification-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and the client:

   ```shell
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the `server` directory. You can use `.env.example` as a template.

4. Start the server:

   ```shell
   # From the 'server' directory
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the client:

   ```shell
   # From the 'client' directory
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running, and you can access it in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the notification system.

2. Sign in or create an account.

3. Interact with the application to trigger notifications (e.g., like, comment, share a post).

4. You will receive real-time notifications for these events in the notification panel.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `client/`: Contains the React-based front-end application.
- `server/`: Contains the Node.js server using Socket.io for real-time communication.
- `shared/`: Contains shared code, constants, and utilities between the client and server.
